### Prompt for Cursor

**Objective**: Regenerate the CSS styles for the Speaking Course Design, ensuring compatibility with Hostinger's restrictions and preventing vertical scroll conflicts. The design should be section-by-section, aligning with the HTML structure and JavaScript functionalities.

---

### **Instructions for Cursor:**

1. **Analyze HTML and JavaScript:**
   - Review the `Self-talk.html` file to understand the HTML structure.
   - Examine JavaScript files (`main.js`, `voice-recording.js`, `quiz-system.js`) to identify dynamic functionalities and class interactions.

2. **CSS Regeneration:**
   - **Color Scheme**: Maintain the existing color scheme defined in the CSS variables.
   - **Typography**: Ensure font sizes and families are consistent across sections, using the `Inter` font.
   - **Layout**: Use a responsive design with flexbox or grid for layout management. Ensure the `.lesson-container` and other sections adapt to different screen sizes without causing overflow.
   - **Spacing**: Use CSS variables for consistent spacing and padding across elements.
   - **Animations**: Implement smooth transitions for interactive elements, adhering to the defined `transition` variables.
   - **Responsive Design**: Ensure the layout is mobile-friendly, adjusting navigation and content display for smaller screens.

3. **Hostinger Compatibility:**
   - Avoid using `vh` units that might cause vertical scroll issues.
   - Implement dynamic height adjustments using JavaScript if necessary, ensuring iframes and other elements fit within the viewport.

4. **Section-by-Section Design:**
   - **Header**: Style the `.lesson-header` with a gradient background and ensure text visibility.
   - **Navigation**: Style the `.lesson-nav` for both desktop and mobile, ensuring smooth transitions and visibility.
   - **Content Sections**: Style each content section (`#objectives`, `#video`,`#vocab``#phrases``#practice ``#book trial ssession` etc.) with distinct headers and consistent padding.
   - **Interactive Elements**: Style buttons and links with hover effects and accessibility in mind.

5. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Minify CSS and use external hosting (e.g., jsDelivr) for faster loading.
   - Use `defer` for JavaScript files to prevent blocking rendering.

6. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Ensure styles are tested across multiple browsers and devices.
   - Validate CSS for any errors or warnings.

### **Additional Considerations:**

- **Accessibility**: Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard navigation.
- **SEO**: Use semantic HTML elements where possible to improve SEO.
