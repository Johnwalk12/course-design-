3.  Video content script: It’s 5 p.m. and you’ve just realized 
that report you’ve been putting off 
is due tomorrow. 
It’s time to buckle down, 
open your computer... 
and check your phone. 
Maybe catch up on your favorite
YouTube channel? 
Actually, you should probably 
make dinner first. 
You usually like cooking, 
though it’s hard to enjoy with this work
hanging over your head, 
and oh— it’s actually pretty late! 
Maybe you should just try again
in the morning? 
This is the cycle of procrastination,
and I promise you, we have all been there. 
But why do we keep procrastinating 
even when we know it’s bad for us? 
To be clear, putting something off isn’t
always procrastinating. 
Responsible time management requires
deciding which tasks are important 
and which ones can wait. 
Procrastination is when we avoid a task 
we said we would do, for no good reason, 
despite expecting our behavior 
to bring negative consequences. 
Obviously, it’s irrational to do something
you expect to harm you. 
But ironically, procrastination is the 
result of our bodies trying to protect us, 
specifically by avoiding a task 
we see as threatening. 
When you realize you need
to write that report, 
your brain responds like it would
to any incoming threat. 
Your amygdala, a set of neurons 
involved in emotional processing 
and threat identification, 
releases hormones including adrenaline
that kick off a fear response. 
This stress-induced panic can overpower
the impulses from your prefrontal cortex, 
which typically help you think 
long term and regulate your emotions. 
And it’s in the midst
of this fight, flight, or freeze response 
that you decide to handle the threat 
by avoiding it in favor
of some less stressful task. 
This response might seem extreme— 
after all, it’s just a deadline,
not a bear attack. 
But we’re most likely to procrastinate
tasks that evoke negative feelings, 
such as dread, incompetence,
and insecurity. 
Studies of procrastinating university
students have found participants 
were more likely to put off tasks they
perceived as stressful or challenging. 
And the perception of how difficult
the task is 
increases while you’re putting it off. 
In one experiment, students were given
reminders to study throughout the day. 
While they were studying,
most reported that it wasn’t so bad. 
But when they were procrastinating, 
they consistently rated the idea
of studying as very stressful, 
making it difficult to get started. 
Because procrastination is motivated
by our negative feelings, 
some individuals are more susceptible
to it than others. 
People who have difficulty
regulating their emotions 
and those who struggle 
with low self-esteem 
are much more likely to procrastinate, 
regardless of how good
they are at time management. 
However, it's a common misconception
that all procrastinators are lazy. 
In the body and brain, laziness is marked
by no energy and general apathy. 
When you’re feeling lazy, you’re more
likely to sit around doing nothing 
than distract yourself 
with unimportant tasks. 
In fact, many people procrastinate
because they care too much. 
Procrastinators often report
a high fear of failure, 
putting things off because they’re afraid
their work 
won’t live up to their high standards. 
Whatever the reason for procrastination, 
the results are often the same. 
Frequent procrastinators are likely 
to suffer from anxiety and depression, 
ongoing feelings of shame, 
higher stress levels and physical ailments
associated with high stress. 
Worst of all, while procrastination
hurts us in the long run, 
it does temporarily reduce
our stress level, 
reinforcing it as a bodily response
for coping with stressful tasks. 
So, how can we break the cycle
of procrastination? 
Traditionally, people thought 
procrastinators needed to cultivate 
discipline and practice 
strict time management. 
But today, many researchers
feel the exact opposite. 
Being too hard on yourself can layer
additional bad emotions onto a task, 
making the threat even more intense. 
To short-circuit this stress response, 
we need to address and reduce
these negative emotions. 
Some simple strategies include breaking
a task into smaller elements 
or journaling about why
it's stressing you out 
and addressing those underlying concerns. 
Try removing nearby distractions that make
it easy to impulsively procrastinate. 
And more than anything, it helps to
cultivate an attitude of self-compassion, 
forgiving yourself,
and making a plan to do better next time. 
Because a culture that perpetuates
this cycle of stress and procrastination 
hurts all of us in the long term.
